Every niche has their own sublanguage.  This language can often feel intimidating, exclusive, not to mention often overused.   While your are immersed in it's native environment, the optimal method to dealing with this discomfort is to determine a low stakes way to interact with this seemingly foreign language.  After all, you are now a member of this community too!

Buzzword bingo gives you the opportunity to take notice of your community's most popular phrases and celebrate you collective ridiculousness.  

This mobile friendly app allows you to create a board of 16 words or phrases of your choice that are all the buzz in your group.  "Your group" can be your friends, your family, members of a hackthon dedicated to providing opportunities for newbies to give hacking a trying in a friendly, supportive environment, or any other conference or small group you attend.

Once you, the user has populated the board, you begin the quest to highlight four phrases in a row.  The exact rules as to what qualifies is up to you.  For example, you may hear these phrases said, perhaps a speaker at the previously mentioned hackthon says a few of these.  Once you manage to complete a row, bask in the glory of your success, and reflect on how you mastered a few key phrases in this now not so foreign language.

Sometimes sublanguage and buzzwords are a necessary evil, but with Buzzword Bingo, you can feel at home in this new colony.
